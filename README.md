# Application-closer
Simple Python application timer, currently without GUI.  Allows choice of application, timer, time when a warning will go off and will optionally save these settings along with username and presetname for later use.

Potential sound customisation?  could be quite hard due to the fact that winsound will only use wav files and playsound is stupid and was constantly coming up with errors, meaning the final lines of code did not execute properly.
